I'm a software developer with experience in backend development, using a variety of technologies including Python, Django, Flask, Docker, among others. During the pandemic (2020 - 2022), I refined my ability to work effectively in remote work environments with distributed companies, and I became quite familiar with cross-functional tools like Git for version control and project management with Jira.

I possess a high level of English proficiency, with a C2 Proficiency certification. This skill has allowed me to work effectively in multicultural teams and international environments.

I enjoy tackling projects from a product perspective and then diving into the technical details. This duality brings me closer, at times, to the role of a technical Product Owner, and at other times, to that of a programmer with architecture knowledge.

I have acquired a deep understanding of SOLID principles, GOF design patterns, Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology, and clean architectures, which enables me to develop robust and maintainable solutions.

Although most of my experience is on backend development, I also have intermediate knowledge of video game creation using Unity & C#, and basic knowledge of Unreal and C++. This diversity in my training has allowed me to explore different forms of creative thinking and tackle problems in an innovative way.
