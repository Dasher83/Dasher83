Hi, Dasher here! Nice to meet you. 

Iâ€™m a programmer with great soft skills and experience in backend development.

Game development is my current adventure.

Gameplay development and game balance are my strong suits.

As a gamer, RPG, strategy, survival & fighting games are my favorite genres.
At the time of writing, the three games closer to my heart are: Subnautica, Dragon Quest Vlll and Hajime no Ippo.
