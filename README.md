I have game development skills using Unity & C#, including genres like endless runner, tower defense and trivia.
I’ve got a C2 Proficiency in English certificate.

I’m currently enrolled on a bootcamp taught by Quark Academy that converts software developers into game developers.
My team won first place at Quark Academy’s #1 Game Jam.
I mentor initial and intermediate level students at the academy during Game Jams. 
I boost the performance of teams using my soft skills, supporting my teammates so they can show more of their potential.

During the pandemic (2020 - 2022), I accumulated experience as a backend software developer, mainly using Python as a programming language and Django as a framework. This allowed me to learn how to incorporate myself with ease to remote workflows in distributed companies, leveraging the GIT versioning system and project administration tools such as Jira.

Game balance just fascinates me!
Working alongside a group of people striving to make a quality entertainment product that gamers will love pushes me forward.
